In this episode of DejaVue, Alex and Michael are joined by Jared Wilcurt, UI architect and open source contributor, to get knee-deep into the world of testing in Vue.js, especially Snapshot Testing.

Jared shares his journey from React frustration to Vue enthusiasm, and explains how he identified gaps in Vue's testing ecosystem that led to the creation of his Vue 3 Snapshot Serializer library.
No matter if you are a testing novice, wondering why you should bother with tests at all, or an experienced developer looking to improve your snapshot testing workflow, this episode got something for you - from reducing test noise, improving readability, and gaining confidence in your Vue applications and components.

Discover how snapshot testing complements traditional assertion-based tests and why it might be the missing piece in your testing strategy.

Enjoy the episode!
