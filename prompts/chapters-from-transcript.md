# Process for Creating Chapter Markers from Podcast Transcripts

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step process for creating chapter markers from DejaVue podcast transcripts. Chapter markers help listeners navigate episodes more efficiently by breaking down content into digestible sections.

## Process Steps

### 1. Review the Complete Transcript

- Read through the entire transcript to understand the flow of conversation and identify natural topic transitions.
- Pay attention to when hosts explicitly mention moving to a new topic or subject.

### 2. Identify Main Topics and Transitions

- Look for clear transitions such as:
  - Introduction of new concepts
  - Phrases like "let's talk about..." or "moving on to..."
  - Questions that shift the conversation direction
  - Natural pauses before new subject matter
- Mark these timestamps as potential chapter boundaries

### 3. Select Chapter Boundaries

- Choose timestamps where topics clearly begin
- Ideal chapter timestamps typically occur:
  - When a host introduces a new topic
  - After concluding remarks on a previous topic
  - When there's a distinct shift in conversation focus

### 4. Create Chapter Titles

- Keep titles concise (typically 2-7 words)
- Make titles descriptive of the content within that section
- Use consistent capitalization (title case is preferred)
- Avoid complete sentences - use phrases instead
- Include important technical terms mentioned in that section

### 5. Format Chapter Markers

Format each chapter marker with:
- Timestamp in HH:MM format (or MM:SS for shorter episodes)
- Chapter title directly after the timestamp
- Example: `00:54 Nuxt 3.16 Feature Overview`

### 6. Review and Refine

- Ensure chapter markers are evenly distributed (aim for 10-20 chapters per hour)
- Check that no important sections are missed
- Combine very short sections if they cover related topics
- Verify timestamps accurately match the transcript

### 7. Finalize Chapter Markers File

- Save as a separate text file with the naming convention: `content/[episode-number]/chapters.txt`
- Format: one chapter marker per line with timestamp and title
- Example:
```
00:00 Intro
00:54 Nuxt 3.16 Feature Overview
```

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Length**: Aim for chapters that are 2-5 minutes in length.
2. **Special Markers**: Always include an intro marker (typically 00:00).
3. **Technical Topics**: When the episode discusses technical concepts, make those chapter titles specific and searchable.
4. **Balance**: Maintain a balance between too many chapters (overwhelming) and too few (not helpful enough).
5. **Contextual Naming**: Name chapters so they make sense even without having listened to the episode.
